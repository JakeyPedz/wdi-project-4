# wdi-project-4

## First task is to get the data of several different Crowdfunding platforms.


Need to do NG-Resource so I can access it in the back

also need to create my models in the front end.


Ones working at the moment

- Crowdcube (saved to db)
- Early Shares (saved to db)
- Invesdor (saved to db)
- Seedrs



- Crowdcube: getting data # (DONE)
- Crowdfunder: getting data types but not content #
- Early Shares: just need to get the logo working # (DONE)
- Equity Net: just need to get the logo working # (IMPOSSIBLE)
- Indiegogo: not getting anything (but no errors) #
- Invesdor - getting data types but not content and check out the odd and even discrepency # (DONE)
- Seedrs: just need to get the logo working # (DONE)
- We Funder: not getting anything (but no errors)


- Fundable - not ideal in terms of scraping
- Circle Up - not ideal in terms of scraping
