    <h2>The Mecca for Alternative Financing </h2><br>

<p>The Qrowded platform will look to aggregate projects and campaigns from numerous leading alternative finance platforms spread across many different funding types. Qrowded will centralise projects from Equity, Debt, Rewards, Donations, Real Estate and Invoice Finance platforms, centralising these opportunities into our investor hub. Each funding type will gradually be incorporated onto the Qrowded platform ensuring an equally seamless investing experience across the diverse range of funding methods.
<br><br><br>

Qrowded will initially only work alongside and partner with the leading platforms to ensure a level of rigour in the procedural procurement and due diligence carried out on hosted offerings. Once lesser platforms (based solely on due diligence process) have reached these standards we will look to plug-in and host their offerings. In doing so, we will look to provide users with the most comprehensive and diverse funding experience available, however looking to minimise exposure to poorly reviewed listings.</p>
